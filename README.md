# Netflix Dashboard Project

## Overview

This project is a dynamic R-based dashboard designed to analyze and visualize Netflix userbase data. Using Shiny, `ggplot2`, and various visualization libraries, the dashboard provides insights into user demographics, subscriptions, devices, revenue, and geographies. The visuals aim to make critical data insights accessible for decision-making and detailed analysis.

## Features

The dashboard is composed of multiple analytic components:
1. **User Demographics**:
   - Histogram showcasing Netflix userbase distribution by age.
   - Stacked bar chart visualizing population counts by country and gender.

2. **Subscription Insights**:
   - 3D pie chart for the breakdown of subscription types (Basic, Standard, Premium).
   - Pie chart illustrating revenue generated from subscription types.

3. **Device Analytics**:
   - Bar plot representing device usage for accessing Netflix (e.g., Laptop, Smart TV, Smartphone, and Tablet).

4. **Revenue Analysis**:
   - Scatter plot indicating revenue generated by different countries.

## Installation

### Requirements

  - `dplyr`

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NetflixDashboardProject.git
    cd NetflixDashboardProject
    ```
2. Open the R environment and set your working directory:
    ```R
    setwd("path_to_project_directory")
    ```
3. Ensure that `msgs.csv` and `Netflix_Userbase.csv` are available within the project directory.
4. Install the required R packages:
    ```R
